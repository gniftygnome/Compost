# <p align="center">COMPOST</p>

Compost is a Fabric mod that makes composters compost organic materials into dirt! Have you ever thought that bone meal wasn't quite the right product that a composter should bring to Minecraft? Well now you can use them to produce dirt! Bring out the true essence of a composter and get dirty!

### Source Building

To build from source you will need have JDK 17 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

#### Commands

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, decide which branch you wish to compile, and then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --branch Fabric-1.18 --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/compost.git

cd ./blossom

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
